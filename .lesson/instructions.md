# Make Task

## What's a 'Make' Task?

In these tasks you have to use the skills learned in the previous exercises to create a new program based on the requirements below.

Write a program that:

- Assigns the password 'abc123' to a variable with a sensible identifier.
- Asks the user to input their username and password and stores them in two new variables.
- Loops until the user enters the password 'abc123'.
- Outputs 'Login accepted' when the user does enter 'abc123'

### EXTRA CHALLENGES - Add these features.
- The username entered is displayed as part of the 'Login accepted' message.
- The user gets an 'Error, incorrect password' message if they get the password wrong.
- The program keeps count of how many tries the user takes to get the password right.  This number is output as part of the 'Login successful' message.
